# Blog Platform

This is a simple blog platform built with **Next.js** for the frontend, **ShadCN** for UI components, and **api.freeapi.app** for the backend API.

## Getting Started

This project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### Running the Development Server
```bash
npm dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will auto-update in the browser as you make changes.

This project uses the `next/font` optimization feature to automatically load and optimize the Geist font family, provided by Vercel, for better performance.
